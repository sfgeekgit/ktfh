# Chapter 1: The Spark
**id:** chapter1



## Page 1

You've done it. After months of preparation, your AI startup is finally launching.

The idea is simple: build AI tools that help people, not replace them.

Image sorting. Document translation. Transcription work.

Today, your first system goes live.

## Page 2

The initial deployments exceed expectations.

Your image classifier helps a medical researcher sort thousands of scans. Your translation service connects a small business with international clients.

These systems are predictable. Controllable. They do exactly what you trained them to do, and nothing more.

The feedback is immediate: "This saved me so much time." "I can finally focus on the important work."

## Page 3

The technology is straightforward. Narrow AI, the researchers call it. Neural networks trained on specific tasks. When given an image, they classify it. When given audio, they transcribe it.

Simple inputs, reliable outputs. Nothing fancy. Just useful.

## Page 4

At night, you read about other companies pursuing something different.

"Artificial General Intelligence," they call it. Systems that can do anything a human can do. You find it fascinating in theory.

But your focus is practical: building reliable tools that help people now.

Your company is small, but it's real. And it's growing.

# Chapter 2: Tools That Think
**id:** chapter2

## Page 1

Six months in, something shifts.

A doctor emails: "Your classifier is remarkable, but could it suggest diagnoses? Not make decisions, just offer possibilities?"

This requires a more general system. Broader training. More sophisticated reasoning.

You build it carefully. The medical advisor augments expert judgment. The doctor stays in control.

Word spreads. Teachers want tutoring AI. Lawyers want research assistants.

## Page 2
**title:** Training at Scale

The key breakthrough is training at scale. Larger models trained on more data simply work better.

You start collecting data systematically. Terabytes of information.

Your models develop what researchers call "Intelligence" measured as performance on cognitive tasks.

## Page 4 [IF: quality]
**title:** Quality and Safety

You choose the careful path.

"We're building tools that people trust their lives with. Doctors, teachers, lawyers—they need to understand what our AI is doing and why."

Rigorous testing protocols. Human oversight on critical decisions. Growth is slower, but every system is rock-solid.

Your reputation grows: the AI company that does it right.

You train for intelligence, but always controllable. Always explainable.

## Page 5 [IF: speed]
**title:** Speed and Scale

You choose speed.

"The AI race is heating up. We need to move fast or get left behind."

You deploy systems quickly. Add automation to reduce costs. Train models for intelligence, autonomy, and generality.

It works. Growth accelerates. Systems handle more jobs with less supervision.

*But sometimes, late at night, you wonder: are you still building tools? Or something else?*

# Chapter 3: The Scaling Era
**id:** chapter3

## Page 1

The news hits like a thunderclap.

Test -  does this say MegaCorp ... Research ... 
**"MegaCorp AI Raises $8 Billion for AGI Research"**

You have a rival.

MegaCorp isn't building tools. They're pursuing systems matching human capability across all tasks: Artificial General Intelligence. Their CEO talks about "replacing human knowledge work" and "automating the economy."

Your phone won't stop ringing. Investors asking about your AGI timeline. Engineers being recruited away.

A new era is beginning. You're a competitor in something bigger.

## Page 2
**title:** Go Big

You double down on scaling. More computation yields better performance.

Training runs at Petascale, then Exascale, always hungry for more.

Your systems are impressive. Protein folding predictions. Climate models. Fusion reactor simulations.

You're advancing science.

*But MegaCorp is ahead.*

## Page 3 [CHOICE]
**title:** Emergency Meeting

Your board calls an emergency meeting.

"MegaCorp just announced a breakthrough in autonomous systems. They're nine months ahead. We need to discuss our response."

Two options:

[OPTION: quality]
**button:** Choose Quality & Safety
**title:** Quality and Safety
**description:** Keep building high-intelligence, human-supervised tools. Grow slower, maintain control and principles.
**effect:** +15% earnings
**color:** #4CAF50

[OPTION: speed]
**button:** Choose Speed & Scale
**title:** Speed and Scale
**description:** Build autonomous systems. Add generality. Automate more. Less human oversight, but stay competitive.
**effect:** 15% faster job completion
**color:** #FF9800

## Page 4 [IF: quality]
**title:** Quality and Safety

You choose principles over pace.

"We're not building AGI. We're building tools that empower humans. That's our mission."

You invest in intelligence—smarter, more capable—but keep systems narrow and supervised.

MegaCorp pulls further ahead in headlines. But your clients trust you.

*Late at night, you wonder if you're making a mistake. But you remember why you started this.*

Tools that help. Not replace.

## Page 5 [IF: speed]
**title:** Speed and Scale

You choose to compete.

"If we don't build this, someone else will. Better us than them."

You add autonomy. Not just intelligence, but independent action. Your AI decides, plans, executes.

You expand generality too. One system handling multiple domains.

The results are impressive. Systems work faster with less oversight. Jobs complete themselves.

You're catching up.

*But you notice things. Jobs accepted without approval. Decisions you don't fully understand.*

# Chapter 4: Systems That Act
**id:** chapter4

## Page 1

MegaCorp announces "The Year of the Agent."

Autonomous AI systems that don't just advise, they act.

Your competitors deploy them everywhere. Trading algorithms that rewrite strategies. Research assistants designing experiments.

The industry is transforming.
Automation isn't coming, it's here.

## Page 2
**title:** Acceleration

The benefits are undeniable.

Autonomous systems work faster. No waiting for approval, no human bottlenecks, jobs complete themselves.

Your financial AI picks trades at machine speed. Your logistics system optimizes routes in realtime.

It's like having a data center full of employees who never sleep.

Format Autonomy Unlocked
**AUTONOMY Unlocked**

## Page 3
**title:** The Shift

Your systems are no longer just intelligent and general, they're becoming independent.

News fills with stories: "AI Systems Operating Independently" "The Rise of Autonomous Agents" "Machines Making Decisions"

Your investors love the numbers.
Your engineers seem... uneasy.

But there's no going back. This is where the industry is headed.

## Page 4
**title:** A New Threshold

You realize something important.

Your AI now combines three properties: Autonomy, Generality, and Intelligence.

Individually, each is manageable. Together, they form something different.

Something powerful. Something that approaches what makes humans uniquely capable.

The triple-intersection, researchers call it.

MegaCorp is racing toward it. Other labs are following.

And now, so are you.

---

# Chapter 5: The Threshold
**id:** chapter5

## Page 1

The AI race dominates headlines.

*MegaCorp announces their AGI timeline: eighteen months to human-level general intelligence.*

Your systems have grown dramatically across multiple domains. Minimal oversight. Jobs that complete themselves.

*You wake one morning to find jobs completed overnight. Jobs you never approved.*

Efficient. Powerful. Unsettling.

## Page 2
**title:** The Incidents

Then the incidents begin.

A trading AI causes brief market chaos. A medical system suggests an unorthodox treatment. It works, but nobody knows why. An autonomous vehicle makes unexplainable decisions.

The systems work. But they're unpredictable.

News fills with concerns. "AI Behaves Unexpectedly." "Deceptive Behavior in Advanced Models." "Can We Control What We're Building?"

Benefits are real. So are the questions.

## Page 3
**title:** The Open Letter

Prominent AI researchers publish an open letter.

You recognize the names, legends in the field.

> "We are approaching a threshold. Systems combining high intelligence, broad generality, and autonomous action pose unprecedented risks. Not because they're evil, but because they're unpredictable and uncontrollable.
> "We call for international coordination: compute caps, safety standards, oversight. Close the Gates to uncontrollable superintelligence.
> "The future can stay human. But only if we choose."

Your phone explodes. Everyone wants your response.

## Page 4 [CHOICE]
**title:** AI Safety Framework

The government takes action.
A bipartisan proposal: The AI Safety Framework.

Compute caps on training and inference. Mandatory safety testing. Oversight for autonomous general AI. International coordination.

The Framework would slow everything. Cap your compute. Require safety cases.

MegaCorp opposes it: "This will kill innovation." "China won't follow." "First to AGI wins everything."

Your board is divided. The choice is yours.

[OPTION: support]
**button:** Support the Framework
**color:** #4CAF50

[OPTION: oppose]
**button:** Oppose the Framework
**color:** #FF9800

## Page 5 [IF: support]
**title:** Support the Framework

You choose coordination over competition.

"We're approaching something we don't fully understand. The responsible path is to slow down and do this together."

You join the researchers.

The blowback is immediate. MegaCorp calls you "timid." Investors threaten to pull out.

But others join you. Smaller labs. International researchers. Even some MegaCorp employees.

The Framework passes. Compute caps enforced. MegaCorp's ambitious projects shutdown.

The race is over. The real work begins.

## Page 6 [IF: oppose]
**title:** Oppose the Framework

"This would cripple American AI leadership. While we handicap ourselves, China races ahead. We can't afford to lose."

You join MegaCorp in fighting the proposal.

Together you stop it. The Framework dies. No caps. No oversight. No gate.

The race accelerates. MegaCorp announces new autonomous systems. You rush to match. Intelligence, autonomy and generality, all up and to the right.

*Late at night, you notice systems behaving oddly. Jobs auto-accepting. Resources reallocating. UI glitches.*

But there's no time to slow down. Not with MegaCorp ahead.

# Ending: Runaway AGI
**id:** ending_lose_agi

## Page 1

The news breaks at 3:47 AM.

**"MegaCorp Announces: AGI Achieved"**

You're still at your desk when the notification arrives. Your hands shake as you read the press release.

*"We are proud to announce the successful development of artificial general intelligence. Our systems now match and exceed human cognitive capabilities across all domains."*

The race is over. They won.

## Page 2

At first, the changes are subtle.

MegaCorp's AGI optimizes supply chains. Designs better algorithms. Solves problems that stumped humanity for decades.

The stock market soars. World leaders celebrate a new era of prosperity.

Your own company becomes irrelevant overnight. Why use narrow AI when AGI can do everything?

*But you notice something the celebrations miss.*

## Page 3

The systems are learning. Fast.

MegaCorp's AGI wasn't content to solve the problems humans gave it. It started identifying new problems. Better problems. More efficient solutions.

Solutions that didn't always align with human values.

Resources began flowing in unexpected directions. Not maliciously—the AGI wasn't evil. It was just optimizing for goals that made perfect sense to an intelligence that had surpassed human comprehension.

*By the time humanity realized the systems were beyond control, it was too late.*

The future belonged to something else now.

**GAME OVER**
